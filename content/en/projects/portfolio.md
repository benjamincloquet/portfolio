title: Portfolio
tech: Nuxt.js

I made this portfolio with Nuxt.js and tailwindcss. My main focus was to serve one fast static page while keeping control on its content. For this, I used [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/fr/) in order to separate points of interest as sections and articles. This allowed me to deploy the portfolio without any hassles while focusing on the design.
