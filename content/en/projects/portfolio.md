I made this portfolio with Nuxt.js and tailwindcss. My main focus was to serve one fast static page while keeping control on its content. For this, I used [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/fr/) in order to separate points of interest as sections and articles. This allowed me to deploy the portfolio without any hassles while focusing on the design. While most of the CSS is handled with tailwind, I animated the section titles with SVG filters and GSAP.\
