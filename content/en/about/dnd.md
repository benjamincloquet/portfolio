I have been playing dungeons & dragons for years - I love the social aspect of it and the collaborative effort to write a story where everyone gets involved in their own way. As a player and dungeon master, the pandemic has been an opportunity to explore tabletop games while distancing through online platforms, which sparked my interest in developing tools to improve the game experience.
