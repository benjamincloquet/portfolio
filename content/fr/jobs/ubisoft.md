I worked as a gameplay programmer for Ubisoft Montpellier. I was put in charge of the development of multiple features in an agile environment, from alpha to post-launch. I learned how to write production-ready C++ components within AAA scale projects, collaborating with designers in an international setting involving five different studios around Europe.\
Check out the two projects I worked on here :
